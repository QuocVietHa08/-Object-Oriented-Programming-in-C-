- Operator functions are same as normal functions. The only differences are the name of an operator function is always operator keyword followed by symbol of operator and operator function called when the corresponding operator is used.
- Almost all operators can be overloaded except few. And there are sowe inportant about operator overloading:
 
+ For operator overloading to work,at least one of the operators must be a user definded class object
+ Assignment Operator : Compiler automatically create a default assignment operator with every class. The default assignment operator does assign all members of right side to the left side and works fine most of the cases (this behavior is same as copy constructor).
+ Conversion Operator : We can also write conversion operators that can be used to convert one type to another type.
